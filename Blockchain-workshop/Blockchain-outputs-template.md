# Expected outputs

## Introduction

Number of people in the room: 16 - came after 1

How many are interested in:

* blockchain? 9
* research communication? 7
* both? 7
* neither? ….

Some hopes/expectations from today’s session:
1) potentially marrying blockchain with academic publishing
2) what is the ecosystem we want?
3) Is blockchain the technology we are looking for?
4) What is blockchain?
5) Can blockchain we applied to different industries?

**Vote at start:**
Blockchain for research: is it …?

* opportunity: … 8
* hype: … 6
* don’t know/not sure: … 4
* both 1
* inappropriate 1

## What is vision for research communication?

What is academic publishing?
Sharing the work of science, this also has a preservation aspect
Ideas need to be judged so they can become something greater
Visibility and credit is also important
Findability, efficient to find

**10 minutes**
* What are key features or requirements?
* What is lacking or problematic in current system?

**POST-IT MAIN POINTS - PINK AND YELLOW**

## What is opportunity for blockchain?

What is blockchain?
* A distributed ledger
* A sequence of timestamped events that everyone agrees on
* e.g. in finance: transparency of balance before and after a transaction, see the transfer of money, agree that it has happened
* Immutable - stored cryptographically and unable to be forge, so it's a system of truth
* Multiple things could be stored: decisions, hashes: referencing other things (docs, etc), money

**10 minutes**
* What are key features?
* How could these features be applied to academic publishing?

**POST-IT MAIN POINTS - BLUE AND GREEN**

## Is blockchain for research an opportunity?

**MAP THE POST-ITS (5 minutes)**

**DISCUSSION (15 minutes)**

Notes to follow from photo!

Initial notes:
* Distribution - has come up in both camps, but has different meanings. For blockchain, assets are distributed peer-to-peer. These assets are just the record though, not the content. In academic publishing, the problem with distribution is to do with who has the rights to access and use the information (copyright, closed access)
* Integrity - who has done what is described, allows fairer distribution of credit
* Something else
* The process of who gets to be published is currently not inclusive - controlled by a group of experts, typically an old white male game. The principles of blockchain could help make this more inclusive and democratic.

## Conclusion

**LAST 10 MINUTES**

*Document concluding remarks (in live-blog,etc above)*

Note some learnings/reflections from today’s sessions:
1) finding the opportunities - collaborative, diverse, inclusive
2) we're still thinking in journals, that needs to change when we consider fundamental problems
3) would adoption change HOW we do research?
4) is applying a technology going to change a process? or should it be the other way round?
5) how to scale? The cost of the system? We need to consider this

Vote to finish: blockchain for research: is it …?

* opportunity: 14 [number]
* hype: 3 [number]
* don’t know/not sure: 2 [number]
* inappropriate --> stupid

Change? hype --> opportunity, not just for fintech
More confused now, what are the alternative technologies?
