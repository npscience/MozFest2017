# Sessions I'm facilitating

## eLife Open Science Soapbox Lunch
### When? Sunday lunchtime, 12:45-13:45
### Where? Level 8 - Boardroom

Grab your lunch and head up to the Boardroom (level 8) to get collaborative and interactive with (or just sit and absorb) open science.

**Are you leading a project**, or planning to start one, that will help researchers to discover, share, consume or evaluate open research? We invite you to share details about your own project and ways in which the community could help you in a two-minute talk during this event.

**Maybe you are interested to contribute to someone else's project** for open science — come hear what's on offer and meet the people involved!

### Sign up for a slot at the soapbox
To sign up for a slot, you can:
* Post a comment at #6
* Sign up in person at the Open Science Public Park (level 9 - 903, all weekend)
* Sign up at the event — join us on floor 8 from 12:30pm to sign up for any remaining slots
